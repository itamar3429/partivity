# Partivity app

    This application is a product that provides people and businesses all around the world connect.

    When a person needs to plan an event, he'll need to go and search for a good revenue, then maybe a musician, a caterer service or a photographer.

    This project will allow all those services to be acquired in a single place online,

    providing the customer with suggestion of all the services mentioned above and all in one place.

    That's where the businesses come in. Each business may provide multiple services.

    Each allowing the business to customize each service's schedule and allowing customers to book the service at the given date and price.
